## Overview

This lab outlines the process to compile a Docker-based ASP.NET Core web application and deploy it to a **Kubernetes** cluster running on **Azure Container Service (AKS)** using the **Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)**.

[**Azure Container Service (AKS)**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/){:target="_blank"} is the quickest way to use Kubernetes on Azure. AKS provides capabilities to deploy and manage Docker containers using Kubernetes, Docker Swarm and Mesosphere DC/OS orchestrators. With AKS, customers get the benefits of the open source Kubernetes without the complexity and the operational overhead. VSTS helps in creating the application container Docker images for faster deployments reliably using the continuous build option.

Below are the description for the terminolgy used in the lab document to help you get started:

[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"}: Docker is a software technology that provides operating-system-level virtualization to easily deploy applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on Linux.

[**Images**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/#docker-objects){:target="_blank"}: An image is a read-only template with the necessary instructions required for the application to run.

[**Containers**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/#docker-objects){:target="_blank"}: Provides an isolated environment in which an app along with its environment is run.

[**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/){:target="_blank"}: Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

[**Pods**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/){:target="_blank"}: A Pod is the basic building block of Kubernetes and represents a executable unit of work. A Pod usually contains a single container.

[**Services**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/){:target="_blank"}: A service tells other pods about the services your application provides.

[**Deployments**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/){:target="_blank"}: A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods

[**Kubernetes Manifest file**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/){:target="_blank"}: Kubernetes manifests with deployments, services and pods can be defined in json or yaml. The file extensions .yaml, .yml, and .json can be used.

### What's covered in this lab

In this lab, the following tasks will be performed:

* Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR), AKS and Azure SQL server

* Provision the VSTS Team Project with a .NET Core application using the [VSTS Demo Generator](https://vstsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/?Name=aks&templateId=77372){:target="_blank"} tool

* Configure endpoints (properties) in VSTS to access Azure and AKS

* Configure application and database deployment using Continuous Deployment (CD) in VSTS

* Modify database connection string & ACR configuration in the source code

* Initiate the build to automatically deploy the application

## Reference Architecture

The below diagram details the VSTS DevOps workflow with Azure Container Service with AKS:

[![VSTS DevOps workflow with Azure Container Service with AKS](images/vstsaksdevops.png)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/architecture/continuous-integration-deployment-containers/){:target="_blank"}

* Firstly, the source code changes are committed to the VSTS git repository

* VSTSÂ will create the custom Docker image **myhealth.web** and push the image tagged with the build ID to the ACR. Subsequently it will publish the [Kubernetes deployment YAML file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/){:target="_blank"} as a build artifact.

* VSTS will deploy **mhc-front** and **mhc-back** services into the Kubernetes cluster using the YAML file.

  {% include important.html content= "**mhc-front** is the application hosted on a load balancer whereas **mhc-back** is the [Redis](https://redis.io/){:target=\"_blank\"} Cache" %}

* The Kubernetes cluster will then pull the **myhealth.web** image from the ACR into the [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/){:target="_blank"} and complete the deployment file instructions
* The myhealth.web application will be accessible through a browser, once the deployment is successfully completed

   ![VSTS Demo Generator](images/vstsdemogen3.png)

## Exercise 1: Service Endpoint creation

Service endpoints are a bundle of properties securely stored by the VSTS and is a way for VSTS to connect to the external systems or services.

Since the connections are not established during project provisioning,the two endpoints - **Azure Resource Manager** and **Kubernetes** need to be created manually.

1. **Azure Resource Manager Service Endpoint**: Defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription using Service Principal Authentication (SPA).

   * In the VSTS, navigate to the **Services** by clicking on the gear icon ![Settings](images/gear.png), and click on the **+ New Service Endpoint** button. Select the **Azure Resource Manager** and specify the **Connection name**, select the **Subscription** from the dropdown and click on the **OK** button. This endpoint will be used to connect the **VSTS** and the **Azure**.

     You will be prompted to authorize this connection with Azure credentials. Disable pop-up blocker in your browser if you see a blank screen after clicking the OK button, and retry the step.

     {% include tip.html content= "If your subscription is not listed or to specify an existing service principal, click the link in the dialog which will switch to manual configuration mode and follow the [Service Principal creation](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2015/10/04/automating-azure-resource-group-deployment-using-a-service-principal-in-visual-studio-online-buildrelease-management/){:target=\"_blank\"} instructions." %}

     ![azureendpoint](images/azureendpoint.png)

1. **Kubernetes Service Endpoint**

   * Click the **+ New Service Endpoint** button, and select **Kubernetes** from the list. We can use this endpoint to connect the **VSTS** and the **Azure Container Service (AKS)**.

     * **Connection Name**: Provide the connection name.

     * **Server URL**: Provide the container service address in the format `http://{API server address}`

     * **Kubeconfig**: To get the Kubeconfig value, run the following Azure commands in a command prompt launched with the Administrator privilege.

      1. Type **az login** in the command prompt and hit Enter. Authorize your login by accessing the url given in the prompt and enter the provided unique code to complete the authentication.

         ![Kubernetes Service Endpoint](images/azlogin.png)

      1. Type **az aks get-credentials --resource-group yourResourceGroup --name yourAKSname** in the command prompt to get the access credentials for the Kubernetes cluster.

         ![Kubernetes Service Endpoint](images/getkubeconfig.png)

     * Navigate to the **.kube** folder under your home directory (eg: C:\Users\YOUR_HOMEDIR\ .kube)

     * Copy the contents of the **config** file and paste it in the Kubernetes Connection window. Click the  **OK** button.

       ![Kubernetes Service Endpoint](images/aksendpoint.png)

## Exercise 2: Configure Build and Release definitions

Now that the connections are established, we will manually map the created Azure endpoint, AKS and Azure Container Registry to the build and release definitions.

{% include note.html content= "If you encounter an error - ***TFS.WebApi.Exception: Page not found*** for Azure tasks in the build / release definition, you can fix this by typing a random text in the Azure Subscription field and click the **Refresh** icon next to it. Once the field is refreshed, you can select the endpoint from the drop down. This is due to a recent change in the VSTS Release Management API. We are working on updating VSTS Demo Generator to resolve this issue." %}

1. Select the **Builds** section under the **Build and Release** hub and **Edit** the build definition **MyHealth.AKS.Build**.

   ![build](images/build.png)

1. In the **Process** section under the **Tasks** tab, select the previously created endpoints from the dropdown for the parameters - **Azure subscription** and **Azure Container Registry** as shown. Click the **Save** option.

    ![updateprocessbd](images/updateprocessbd.png)

    |Tasks|Usage|
    |-----|-----|
    |![icon](images/icon.png) **Run services**| prepares the suitable environment by restoring required packages|
    |![icon](images/icon.png) **Build services**| builds the docker images specified in a **docker-compose.yml** file with registry-qualified names and additional tags such as **$(Build.BuildId)**|
    |![icon](images/icon.png) **Push services**| pushes the docker images specified in a **docker-compose.yml** file, to the container registry|
    |![publish-build-artifacts](images/publish-build-artifacts.png) **Publish Build Artifacts**| publishes the **myhealth.dacpac** file to VSTS|

1. Navigate to the **Releases** section under the **Build & Release** menu, **Edit** the release definition **MyHealth.AKS.Release** and select **Tasks**.

   ![release](images/release.png)

   ![releasetasks](images/releasetasks.png)

1. In the **Dev** environment, under the **DB deployment** phase, update the **Azure Subscription** value from the dropdown for **Execute Azure SQL: DacpacTask** task.

    ![update_CD3](images/update_CD3.png)

1. In the **AKS deployment** phase, Under the **Create Deployments & Services in AKS** task, update the **Kubernetes Service Connection** value from the dropdown. Expand the **Container Registry Details** section and update the parameters - **Azure subscription** and  **Azure Container Registry** with the endpoint components from the dropdown.

1. Repeat similar steps for **Update image in AKS** task.

    ![update_rd1](images/update_rd1.png)

    * **Create Deployments & Services in AKS** will create the deployments and services in AKS as per the configuration specified in **mhc-aks.yaml** file. The Pod, for the first time will pull the latest docker image.

    * **Update image in AKS** will pull the appropriate image corresponding to the BuildID from the repository specified, and deploys the docker image to the **mhc-front pod** running in AKS.

1. Click on the **Variables** section under the release definition, update **ACR** and **SQL server** values for **Process Variables** with the details noted earlier while configuring the environment. Click on the **Save** button.

   {% include note.html content= "The **Database Name** is set to **mhcdb** and the **Server Admin Login** is **sqladmin** and **Password** is **P2ssw0rd1234**." %}

   ![releasevariables](images/releasevariables.png)

## Exercise 3: Update Connection String & ACR URL in the manifest file

We will update the database connection string for the .NET Core application and ACR URL in the manifest YAML file.

1. Click on the **Code** tab, and navigate to the below path `AKS/src/MyHealth.Web` to **edit** the file `appsettings.json`

   Scroll down to the line number **9** and provide the database server name as given in the step 6 of the previous exercise and manually update the **User ID** to `sqladmin` and **Password** to `P2ssw0rd1234`. Click on the **Commit** button.

   {% include important.html content= "\"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=YOUR_SQLSERVER_NAME.database.windows.net,1433;Database=mhcdb;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=sqladmin;Password=P2ssw0rd1234\"" %}

   ![pasteconnectionstring](images/pasteconnectionstring.png)

1. Navigate to the `AKS` path to **edit** the file `mhc-aks.yaml`. This YAML manifest file contains configuration details of **deployments**,**services** and **pods** which will be deployed in Kubernetes.

   Scroll to the line number **93**. modify the value **YOUR_ACR** with your **ACR Login server** which was noted earlier while setting up the environment. Click on the **Commit** button.

   ![editmhcaks](images/editmhcaks.png)

## Exercise 4: Trigger a Build and deploy application

In this exercise, let us trigger a build manually and upon completion, an automatic deployment of the application will be triggered. Our application is designed to be deployed in the pod with the **load balancer** in the front-end and **Redis cache** in the back-end.

1. Click on the **Builds** section under the **Build and Release** tab, click on the build definition **MyHealth.AKS.Build** and then click on the **Queue new build...** button.

    ![manualbuild](images/manualbuild.png)

1. Once the build process starts, navigate to the **Builds** tab. Click on the build number to see the build in progress.

    ![clickbuild](images/clickbuild.png)

    ![buildinprog1](images/buildinprog1.png)

1. The build will generate and push the docker image to ACR. After the build completes, you will see the build summary. To view the generated images in the Azure Portal, click on the **Azure Container Registry** and navigate to the **Repositories**.

    ![imagesinrepo](images/imagesinrepo.png)

1. Switch back to the VSTS portal. Click on the **Releases** section on the **Build & Releases** tab, and double-click on the latest release. Click on the **Logs** section to see the release summary.

    ![releaseinprog](images/releaseinprog.png)

    ![release_summary1](images/release_summary1.png)

1. Once the release is complete, launch the command prompt and run the below command to see the pods running in AKS:

    `**kubectl get pods`

    ![getpods](images/getpods.png)

    The deployed web application is running in the displayed pods.

1. To access the application, run the below command. If you see that **External-IP** is pending, wait for sometime until an IP is assigned.

    `**kubectl get service mhc-front --watch`

    ![watchfront](images/watchfront.png)

1. Copy the **External-IP** and paste it in the browser and hit the Enter button to launch the application.

    ![finalresult](images/finalresult.png)

    **Access AKS through the browser**
    Type the below command in the command prompt to access the AKS through the browser.

    `az aks browse --resource-group <yourResourceGroup> --name <yourAKSname>`

    ![AKS through browser](images/aksbrowse.png)

    **AKS Dashboard:**
    Once the AKS dashboard is launched, the following details will be displayed.

    ![AKS Dashboard](images/aksdashboard.png)

## Summary

AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing a Kubernetes cluster by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. With the **Visual Studio Team Services** and **Azure Container Services (AKS)**, we can build DevOps for dockerized applications by leveraging docker capabilities enabled on VSTS Hosted Agents.
