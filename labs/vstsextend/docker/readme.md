## Overview

This lab outlines the process to build custom Docker images of an [**ASP.NET Core**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/dotnetcore){:target="_blank"} application, push those images to a private repository in [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/container-registry/){:target="_blank"} (ACR). These images will be used to deploy the application to the Docker containers in the **Azure App Service** (Linux) using VSTS.

The Web App for Containers allows creation of custom [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker){:target="_blank"} container images, easily deploy and run them at scale on Azure. Combination of VSTS and Azure integration with Docker will enable the following:

1. [Build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/){:target="_blank"} custom Docker images using [VSTS Hosted Linux agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/agents/hosted){:target="_blank"}

1. [Push](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/){:target="_blank"} and store the Docker images in a private repository

1. Deploy and [run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/){:target="_blank"} the images inside the Docker Containers

The below diagram details the VSTS DevOps workflow with Docker:

1. Once the team project is provisioned, click on the URL to navigate to the team project.

   ![VSTS Demo Generator](images/vstsdemogen3.png)

## Exercise 1: Endpoint Creation

The connection between the VSTS and the Azure is not automatically established during the team project provisioning, and hence the endpoints need to be created manually. This endpoint will be used to connect the **VSTS** with **Azure**. Follow the steps outlined below to create the endpoint.

1. In the VSTS home page, click on the **Settings** gear icon ![Admin Settings](images/gear.png) and then click on the **Services** option to navigate to the **Services** screen.

1. Click on the **+New Service Endpoint** button and select the **Azure Resource Manager** option. Provide  `Connection name`, select the `Azure Subscription` from the list and the click on the **OK** button. The Azure credentials will be required to be provided to authorize the connection.

   ![Endpoint Creation](images/azureendpoint.png)

   {% include important.html content= "Disable the pop-up blocker in your browser. If a blank screen is displayed after the **OK** button is clicked, retry the step." %}

## Exercise 2: Configure Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)

Now that the connection is established, the **Azure endpoint** and the **Azure Container Registry** need to be manually configured for the build and release definitions. The dacpac will also be deployed to the mhcdb database so that the schema and data is configured for the backend.

{% include warning.html content= "TFS.WebApi.Exception: Page not found may be encountered for the Azure tasks in the build / release definition. This issue can be fixed by typing a random text in the Azure Subscription field and then clicking the **Refresh** icon next to it. Once the field is refreshed, the endpoint can be selected from the drop down list. This issue occurrence is due to a recent change in the VSTS Release Management API. The VSTS Demo Generator is being updated to handle this change to prevent this issue." %}

1. Navigate to the **Builds** option under the **Build and Release** tab. Select the build definition `MHCDocker.build`, click on the ellipsis and select the **Edit** option.

   ![Build](images/build.png)

1. In the **Process** section, update the **Azure subscription** and the **Azure Container Registry** with the endpoint component from the dropdown. (use the arrow keys to choose **Azure Container Registry** for the first time). Click on the **Save** button.

   ![Tasks](images/updateprocessbd.png)

   |Tasks|Usage|
